To generate this app, set the mason variables in the file named `app_temp.json` in the root directory of this project.

Run the command `flutter pub run build_runner watch -d` to generate riverpod files and finish the setup.

Here's the command combined into one line:

```bash
& mason make xephas_app -c app_temp.json --on-conflict overwrite; flutter pub run build_runner watch -d

```
