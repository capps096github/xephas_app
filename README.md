## Steps to use on a new project

```bash
# 1. Create a new flutter project
flutter create project_name
# 2. Initialize mason in the project via the command below
mason init
# 3. Add the brick to the project mason.yaml file using one of the 2 methods below
#a) From Github
  # Bricks can also be imported via remote git url.
  # Uncomment the following lines to import the "xephas_app" brick from git.
bricks:
# start here incase the bricks tag is present in the mason.yaml file
  xephas_app:
    git:
      url: https://github.com/capps096github/Cephas-Bricks.git
      path: xephas_app



#b) from file directory incase it is cloned


```

## Ignore some files from being deployed to git

```bash

# 1. In the .gitignore file in the root directory of the project
# 2. Add the following lines to the file to Ignore files generated by mason

mason*

```

## Usage

To use this brick, run the following command: we prefer using a json file to generate the brick since it contains many variables, and any existing files will be overwritten

```bash
mason make xephas_app -c name_of_json_file.json --on-conflict overwrite
```

## Variables

These are highlighted in the json file, but here is a list of the variables that can be used to generate the brick: as listed in brick.yaml file

- app_name
- app_title
- primary_color_code
- secondary_color_code

## Output

This will generate the following directory structure:

```bash
        lib
        â”‚   main.dart
        â”‚   {{app_name}}_exporter.dart
